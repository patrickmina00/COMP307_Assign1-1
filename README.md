# COMP307_Assign1-1
Task:
The assignment was divided into 3 parts namely; making programs for K-NN algorithm, decision tree algorithm and 
implementing perceptron. We were given a set of data that we needed to classify based on the training data and testing data.


Technology used: Mainly Eclipse

Part 1: K-NN Algorithm
Coding part 1 was all about understanding how the algorithm is supposed to work. Most of the time spent on it was spent
learning thing about the algorithm itself and understanding how K-Nearest Neighbor works.
