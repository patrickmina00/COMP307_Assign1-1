# COMP307_Assign1-1
Task:
The assignment was divided into 3 parts namely; making programs for K-NN algorithm, decision tree algorithm and 
implementing perceptron. We were given a set of data that we needed to classify based on the training data and testing data.

Coded in Java
Technology used: Mainly Eclipse

Part 1: K-NN Algorithm
Coding part 1 was all about understanding how the algorithm is supposed to work. Most of the time spent on it was spent
learning thing about the algorithm itself and understanding how K-Nearest Neighbor works.



Running COMP307_Assignments:
As stated on the requirements for the assignment, both assignment parts 1 and 2 require
file names that can be put on Run Configurations. Both parts 1 and 2 run well. The only thing needed for it is to move the data files on the root folder so it can identify the file path.

As for part 3, it's currently running but its not giving me the right output. As of now
the main issue I had was that it wasn't updating the feature values right. To adjust the amount of
iterations the program can do, just change the int value on line 89 while(iteration < intValueHere).
Also MakeImage.java should just be commented out since it's not being used for anything at all.
